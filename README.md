**DDoS Attack Detection Classification with TabNet**

**Description:**

This lab project aims to classify DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks using the TabNet model. DDoS attacks are a common threat to network security, and accurately detecting and classifying them is crucial for maintaining the integrity and availability of network services. The TabNet model offers an effective approach to this problem by leveraging tabular data and hierarchical feature selection.

**Steps:**

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load the dataset containing information about network traffic and attack class labels.
   - Perform preliminary data analysis to understand the structure and characteristics of the data.
   - Preprocess the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Create a `Model` class containing methods for training and evaluating the TabNet model.
   - Train the TabNet model on the preprocessed data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset, including computing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

3. **Results Analysis:**
   - Assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the TabNet model in classifying DDoS attacks.
   - Identify the most important features influencing the classification.

4. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - Discuss the project's results and potential avenues for improving the model's quality.
   - Evaluate the model's applicability in real-world scenarios and its potential contribution to DDoS attack detection.
